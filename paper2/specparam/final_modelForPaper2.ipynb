    "1. Fit group spectra\n",

    "        - Errors\n",
    "        - R-squared\n",
    "    - **Make sure you use the model index to pull relevant information from `df_final`**\n",
    "3. Plot mean spectra with standard deviation for all 11 clusters. (although we will only be using a select few).\n",
